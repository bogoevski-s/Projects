Develop an application for a Car Showroom.

Within the salon there are employees in two roles, sales and procurement. An employee in the role of sales can sell a certain vehicle to a certain user, if it is in stock, while an employee in the role of procurement procures certain vehicles, with certain characteristics, according to the catalog of the vehicle manufacturer.

The salon sells 3 types of vehicles, trucks, vans and cars.
- For the trucks, in addition to the basic information, data is kept on the number of trailers that the truck has. Each truck has a base price which refers to the price of the truck without the price of the trailer included. Each truck has a minimum of 1, a maximum of 2 trailers. The trailer has a base price, which is added to the price of the truck. If the buyer decides to buy 2 trailers, he gets a 10% discount on the price of the second trailer.
- For the van, in addition to the basic information, records are kept for its payload. The price of one van is in accordance with the basic price in the catalog, without the option for additional additions and changes to it.
- For a car, in addition to the basic information, records are kept for the type of vehicle, ie whether it runs on Gasoline, Diesel or Electric (Hybrid model). The basic price refers to a gasoline engine and it varies in case of engine change, as follows:
    - For Diesel selection, + 5% of the basic price
    - For Hybrid selection, + 15% of the basic price

(If you want to extend the models, and thus the task, you can introduce additional items in relation to each vehicle, eg selection of rims, selection of parking sensors, etc., with each choice affecting the base price)

User menu (flow):
- Buyer registers and logs in to the system (if previously registered)
    - Examines all available vehicles by the Salon.
    - Selects the vehicle he wants to buy, and accordingly further makes an additional selection of features for the vehicle.
    - What completes everything, sets the order, which is in the status Pending for Approval

- The seller has an overview of all orders that have been made and accordingly has the option to approve or reject an order. Once the seller approves the order, it is considered realized and the buyer successfully buys the vehicle. The seller may reject the order with a certain explanation, unavailable part, out-of-date data, etc.

- The user in the role of procurement has the opportunity to review the catalog of vehicles in stock, and to order new vehicles from the manufacturer / s. At the moment when the order is made, it is considered realized and the immediately ordered vehicles become available to the buyers.

You are free to expand / shorten the task with new requirements, and to realize them. Many of the details of the task are deliberately not defined, to leave room for each of you to analyze the possible validation situations that the salon would face.
